WebPack is a shell script for automatically packing Web sites by shrinking them without affecting their functionality or appearance.
It is also useful for losslessly shrinking image collections and locating corrupt files.
It works by stripping unnecessary information and optimizing the compression of images, and by removing comments/whitespace from HTML, using readily-available tools.
Bundles both CommonJs and AMD modules (even combined).
Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).
Dependencies are resolved during compilation reducing the runtime size.
Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, coffeescript to javascript, handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64.
Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.
