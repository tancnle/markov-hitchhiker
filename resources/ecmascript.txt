JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape under the name Mocha, later LiveScript, and finally renamed to JavaScript.
In December 1995, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced JavaScript in a press release.
In March 1996, Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released, featuring support for JavaScript.
Owing to the widespread success of JavaScript as a client-side scripting language for Web pages, Microsoft developed a compatible dialect of the language, naming it JScript to avoid trademark issues.
JScript added new date methods to fix the non-Y2K-friendly methods in JavaScript, which were based on the Java Date class.
JScript was included in Internet Explorer 3.0, released in August 1996.
Netscape delivered JavaScript to Ecma International for standardization and the work on the specification, ECMA-262, began in November 1996.
The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.
Several editions of the language standard have been published since then.
ECMAScript is the name of the scripting language standardized in ECMA-262.
The name "ECMAScript" was a compromise between the organizations involved in standardizing the language, especially Netscape and Microsoft, whose disputes dominated the early standards sessions.
Eich commented that "ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin disease."
While both JavaScript and JScript aim to be compatible with ECMAScript, they also provide additional features not described in the ECMA specifications.
